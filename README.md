  ## Description  
  ### What was your motivation?  
    - Create a Workout Tracker using NOSQL, incorporating a provided frontend.  
  ### Why did you build this project?  
    - To further develop techniques used to understand routing and modeling NOSQL databases using mongoose.  
  ### What problem does it solve?  
    - As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts.  I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.  I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.  If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.  
  ### What did you learn making this project?
